HEY THERE!

This is my first app, a pretty basic calculator made with python. To get to the app open the "dist" folder and open calculator.
This app was made on a Mac but should technically function on any computer. 
It may raise security concerns on a Mac as I am an unidentified developer to any new system.

To solve this (if you wish to, there is no malware on this app) go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Allow Anyways and the app should be good to go!!

If you feel like anything could've been done better, drop me a message on twitter (www.twitter.com/aymanxkhan)
